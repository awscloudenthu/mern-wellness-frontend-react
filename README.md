# mern-wellness-frontend-react

This is a React application created for practice with the MERN architecture.

Currently, its functionality is limited to the following features:

- Displays default physical wellness data by calling an API server built with Express and MongoDB, 
  hosted on AWS EC2 and exposed through AWS API Gateway. The server code for 
  the API is available in the repository: mern-wellness-server-express-mongodb.

- Users can perform CRUD operations, but the data is not persisted yet.

- This is a work in progress, and more features will be added, including data persistence.

- It is hosted on AWS S3, distributed through AWS CloudFront, and accessible
